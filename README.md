  ## Description
  I was tasked with making a README generator to make it easier for future projects and to save time. The Application prompts questions for you to answer about your application and then forms the README for you.

  ## Table of Contents

  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Credits](#contribute)
  - [License](#license)
